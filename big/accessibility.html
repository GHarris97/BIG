		<h2>Accesibility</h2>
		 <p>Web accessibility is making sure that websites, tools, and technologies are specifically designed and developed to allow people with disabilities to use them. The web is designed to be used by all people in mind, no matter their personal ability, software, hardware, location, or language. By making sure a website is accessible we are ensuring that all potential users have a meaningful and useful experience even if they are limited by sight, hearing, speech, physical or any other disabilities. Even those without such disabilities can be given an advantage through web accessibility. People using small screen displays, viewing content in bright sunlight, or slow internet can use content a lot easier if given the opportunity through accessibility.</p> 

	<p>Web accessibility should meet certain standards in order to grant access to a range of users. There are many options and  that can be implemented to make a website more useful. Non-text content like pictures, video, or audio should have a text alternative. By using a text alternative that explains the data, users with reading or hearing difficulties can have the opportunity to still fully engage with the page. Closed captions and other alternatives like sign language can also be used to add access to an interface. Text design should be structured around color as those with color blindness rely on contrast to read content. Text and images should be resizable in a way that does not interfere with reading even if they are enlarged multiple times. Users should be able to access a site with not only their mouse but their keyboard too. By ensuring that standards are met we as web designers and web developers ensure that our sites are easily accessible by anybody who uses them no matter if they are limited by any disability.</p>
	
	<p>In order to fully utilize and capitalize websites, tools, and other technologies, web accessibility must be met to full extent. If not, we miss the potential of missing many users who would otherwise take full advantage of our creations if their needs were fully addressed. Web accessibility cannot be ignored and must be kept in mind every time content is created. </p>
