		<h2> Social Media Optimization</h2>
		 <p>Social media optimization, or SMO for short, is the term used to define the utilization of social media as a way to bring an audience and build awareness around a brand or a company. It’s a  relatively low cost way to draw potential users into a specific market by approaching and tapping in to the services they use everyday. This allows for a brand to grow exponentially and reach markets they may have never even come across if not for the use of taking advantage of social media. Not only does SMO lead to brand growth and visibility via an online presence but it’s also a way to connect with an audience and also conduct research into the needs of the customer. While relatively new, social media optimization is extremely important to a brand if it wants to successfully bring in customers, meet goals, and hold value with its desired audience.<p/> 

<p>In order to bring consumers in via social media, content must engage individuals enough to keep them interested with the brand to keep them coming back to use the product. If the audiences needs are not meant that means that there is a high risk of them abandoning their attraction towards the brand, thus resulting in a loss of a customer base which can be detrimental to overall success. Quantity will never beat quality in terms of efficiency. Which means if the goal to keep and grow a consumer base is to be met, then the content posted on social media must give attention to the brand in a positive light rather than spamming users with tiresome content. To do this content must be original and geared towards the audience. Headlines, images, post length, and hashtags among other things should be carefully crafted to build a social media presence that brings in a high amount of traffic and successfully corner a wanted market. <p/>

<p>By taking advantage of the use of social media, companies not only draw in consumers but can use it as a way to research their market and better optimize their product to target audiences needs. Success can be analyzed through activity such as user interaction through likes, comments, sharing, and replies. By using this data an advantage can be gained to understand how the market reacts to the product and how the use of social media can be further developed to gain even more of an audience.<p/>

<p>While social media optimization may seem like it can be easy, it is an extremely thought out process that takes hard work to meet important goals. In today’s world social media cannot be ignored. It is simply too important in the process of reaching out to audiences, gaining new followings, and developing products. By successfully tapping into the ability to harness the power of social media, companies will exponentially heighten the chance of their success in this ever changing competitive world.
